## Teaching

At UCL I have taught first-year applied maths tutorials (2017-18) covering content from Applied Maths, Mathematical Methods I & II, and Newtonian Mechanics. I have also taught introductory python computer labs as part of Mathematical Methods I (2016-19). I have done marking for various courses including Biomathematics and Mathematical Methods I & II.
