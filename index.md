## About me

Currently, I am a postdoc in the Evolutionary Dynamics group led by Benjamin Werner at the Centre for Cancer Genomics and Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute.

I obtained my PhD in mathematical biology from UCL in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Karen Page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucackmp/). Prior to that I completed my MPhys in mathematical physics at the University of Edinburgh in 2016. You can see my [CV](https://jessierenton.github.io/JRenton_CV.pdf) here. I am broadly interested in using mathematical and computational methods to model biological and social systems, in particular evolutionary processes.

## Research
My current research looks at somatic evolution in modular species, such as corals and seagrasses. To do this we employ multilevel population genetics models (see my [Somatic Evolution](https://github.com/jessierenton/SomaticEvolution.jl) Julia package). 

My PhD research was focussed on evolutionary game theory, with applications to cancer evolution. Using the Voronoi tessellation model, I considered how the structure and dynamics of an epithelium affect the invasion probability of cooperative mutations.

## Teaching

At UCL I have taught first-year applied maths tutorials (2017-18) covering content from Applied Maths, Mathematical Methods I & II, and Newtonian Mechanics. I have also taught introductory python computer labs as part of Mathematical Methods I (2016-19). I have done marking for various courses including Biomathematics and Mathematical Methods I & II.
